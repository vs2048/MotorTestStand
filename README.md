# Motor Test Stand
This is a simple motor test stand that modulates a PWM output to a MOSFET based on input from buttons. There is an on and off button and buttons to increase and decrease pulse width.

The counter and button objects control the speed command based on input buttons. The commanded pulse width is displayed on a 16x2 LCD. This is made to work with https://github.com/vs2048/Tachometer running on a second Arduino.
